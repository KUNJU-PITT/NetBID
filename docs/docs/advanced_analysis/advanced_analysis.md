# Advanced analysis

## Part I: for top drivers

### I.1: volcano plot for DE/DA, p-value Vs. fold-change

### I.2: Heatmap for top drivers

### I.3: Function enrichment plot for top drivers

### I.4: Bubble plot for top drivers

### I.5: GSEA plot for top driver

## Part II: for each driver

### II.1: GSEA plot for each driver

### II.2: target network structure for each driver, or two drivers (overlap testing)

### II.3: category plot for the expression/activity for each driver

## Part III: advanced plots

### III.1: input driver and target, get shortest path and draw subnetwork

### III.2: gene set-based activity analysis, including vocalno, heatmap, category and GSEA plot

### III.3: SINBA plot for synergistic effect

## Part IV: Supplementary usage for different conditions

### IV.1: if want to get mean expression/activity value for each phenotype cluster
